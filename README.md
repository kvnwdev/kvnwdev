# 👋 Hi there!

I'm Kevin — a systems-first developer who builds infrastructure for thought.

I've been coding since I was 8, chasing clarity through software ever since. I don't only build tools for fun. I build them because I **hate** friction and *need* them to move faster. The kind of faster that doesn't just feel fast — but *thinks* fast.

---

## What I care about

- 🔁 Reducing cognitive drag
- ⚙️ Building workflows that *feel like extensions of yourself*
- 🧠 Architecting systems that that eliminate friction
- 🔌 Integrating ideas across prompts, agents, APIs, and raw thought

My life's work is about building systems that let me focus more on what matters.

## What I’m building right now

### [`kernix.ai`](https://kernix.ai)  
> Not another platform. A new layer of thought.

Kernix is my cognitive stack. It’s an ecosystem of tools I needed, so I'm building them:

- **Library** – Deployable prompt packs, modular strategies, tool configs  
- **Studio** – A modular "LLM IDE" for workflows and agent chains  
- **Replicate** – A second-you framework (trainable cognition, not personas)  
- **Accelerator** – For solo builders scaling with AI, not headcount

Every layer compounds. Each tool makes the next inevitable.
